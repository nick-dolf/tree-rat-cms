For certain aspects of our services, we may require login information such as username and password, secret answers to certain security questions, or other similar information that allows us to uniquely identify your account or authenticate you prior to giving you access to your account information or certain online activities. We may capture certain information automatically on our Website (even if you do not voluntarily provide us with Personal Information, or in addition to any Personal Information that you do provide), including your Internet protocol address, Internet service provider, browser type, and linking information. Typically, this information is for us to develop aggregated Website server statistics (how many people access our Website and what pages are they interested in). At times, our systems may make this information identifiable to you, and, if so, it will be treated and protected as Personal Information.\r\n\r\n**Non-Personal Information**\r\n\r\nAt other times, we may collect information that cannot be used to directly identify you, such as browser type, Dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address, “click stream” data, and similar non-personally identifiable information. For example, we may aggregate non-personal information about you and other customers who visit certain areas of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you.\r\n\r\nWhile we take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference. In particular, we have not implemented the necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this privacy policy for further updates on this topic.\r\n\r\nFurther, our online service providers or business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across websites. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those websites.\r\n\r\n",

Even though the collection form may have the look and feel of the Website, please be aware you will be giving your information directly to the third party vendor, and that in some instances such third party vendor's privacy policy will govern the collection of your personal information. Please reference the privacy policies available from these pages for any privacy related concerns.\r\n\r\nWe and/or our vendors will use this information to complete the financial or other transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, other services that you request, to invoice you, and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
